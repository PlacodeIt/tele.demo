Updated Script
Description
The updated script includes significant enhancements:

-Configuration Loading: Reads additional configuration details such as phone number.
-Enhanced Logging: Custom logging format to exclude date and include more detailed information about processing steps.
-MongoDB Integration: Functions to check chat existence and add chat details to MongoDB.
-Error Handling: Retry logic for handling errors such as FloodWaitError.
-User Input: Asks the user for the limit of searches and handles invalid input.
-Graceful Shutdown: Signal handling for graceful shutdown on receiving termination signals.
-Data Export: Saves fetched data to JSON and Excel files.

Suggestions for the Future

1.Handling SSL Issues:
Ensure that cryptography and pyOpenSSL libraries are installed and correctly set up in your environment to handle SSL encryption more efficiently.

2.Error Handling and Retries:
Improve error handling to catch and manage different types of exceptions.
Consider adding exponential backoff for retries to handle rate limits more gracefully.

3.Asynchronous Enhancements:
Use more efficient asynchronous techniques to handle large volumes of data and improve performance.
Implement concurrent fetching of channel details to speed up the process.

4.Advanced Logging:
Integrate more advanced logging frameworks that can provide better insights and debugging information.
Consider setting up logging to external systems for real-time monitoring.

5.User Interface Improvements:
Develop a simple user interface or command-line interface (CLI) for better user interaction.
Add more user input validation to enhance user experience.

6.Enhanced Data Management:
Implement better data validation and cleaning processes before storing data in MongoDB.
Consider adding more metadata and indexing for faster data retrieval from the database.

7.Security Considerations:
Ensure that sensitive information such as API keys and tokens are securely managed and not hard-coded in the script.
Implement secure storage and retrieval mechanisms for sensitive data.
